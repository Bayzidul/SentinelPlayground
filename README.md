Sentinel Playground has been pushed open-source to provide more easier start for anyone who's trying to try Sentinel Hub WMS service.
Project is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), more specifically with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
For state management it uses [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). Map is based on [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

## Setting up
```
- npm install
- open src/store/config.js and insert your Sentinel API key
- npm start (for local testing)
- npm run build (prepare application for deploy)
```

## Acquiring Sentinel API key
To use Sentinel WMS service, you need to have your API key. You can get test API key by writing mail to [info@sinergise.com](mailto:info@sinergise.com).
For more info about WMS service, check [www.sentinel-hub.com/apps/wms](http://www.sentinel-hub.com/apps/wms]).

## Have more ideas?
We will be very happy to view some of your own implementation of our Sentinel Playground.
